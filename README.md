## Source Material

When applicable, I have included the source material for each image. These sources may include:

    Original paintings that inspired the AI reinterpretation.
    Photographs I have taken that served as a basis for the generated images.

This inclusion of source materials provides transparency about the origins of the content and insight into the transformation from initial concept to final AI-generated artwork.
Purpose
